README
------

This package contains the CosmoSurvey cosmology survey modeler.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation
instructions.

See the section FAQ in the documentation (doc/cosmosurvey.info) for
frequently-asked questions.  The documentation is also available in
PDF and HTML, provided you have a recent version of Texinfo installed:
run "make pdf" or "make html"

CosmoSurvey requires Cuba 1.5 or later.  See:

http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/

*NOTE:  The Cuba integration package provided by its author at the
 above URL has build and install dependencies on Mathematica, which is
 proprietary software.  However, these dependencies exist only for the
 the tools and not for the core library.  Since CosmoSurvey only uses
 the core integration library, a version of Cuba with a modified build
 system is provided.  See:

http://www.msu.edu/~ventimig

Please send bug reports to <ventimig@msu.edu>.  Please include the
version number from `cosmosurvey --version', and a complete,
self-contained test case in each bug report.

If you have questions about using CosmoSurvey and the documentation
does not answer them, please send mail to <ventimig@msu.edu>.
